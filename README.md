# Rock-Mine-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This is an use case study on the Rock/Mine prediction system using Machine Learning.
In this case study i have build a model using the Logistic Classifier Machine Learning Algorithm.
The model was buld in the python3 environment using the Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.
Libraries used - Numpy for numerical computation, Pandas and SKLearn.
